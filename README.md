# cmd-ecommerce-system

This is our 2nd semester project. We are building a simple E-Commerce System. What this system does is to allow sellers to create account and add products. The buyers, who are not required to create account, will search for products and will buy them. They will first add-to-cart everything they need, and then buy. An invoice will be created. Everything is stored in a text file for permanent storage.
But instead of using a text file plainly, I created a database-ish thing to store all the data in tables. Tables are somewhat made "related" to each other through the use of primary and foreign keys.

## notes
Our instructor did not allow us to use OOP features of Java and any external database. So we must only use what we have studied in our course: Programming Fundamentals.
